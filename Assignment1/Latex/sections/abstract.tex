Autonomous navigation and metaverse are doubly two of the promising areas that benefit hugely to our human beings. With the help of autonomous navigation, we can let the system come up with the fastest route to safely and effortlessly drive us to our destination. While with the help of the metaverse, we can virtually go to many places we want without traveling and the limit of the space capacity. In this paper, I would like to introduce these two technologies, comparing their 3D-sensing tech specs and the challenges they are facing, then talk about their potentials and future trends.
