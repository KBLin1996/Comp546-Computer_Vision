\section{Conclusion}

To sum up, both autonomous navigation and metaverse use plenty of 3D-sensors, such as LiDAR, Camera, and IMU to perceive and simulate their surroundings. However, \textbf{autonomous navigation requires more additional sensors} like Ultrasound and Radar to help the driver keep away from danger and gather more information to help the system better make up decisions.
